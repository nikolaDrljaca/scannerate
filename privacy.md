# Privacy Policy
Scannerate does not collect any personal information.
Should you have any questions or suggestions about my Privacy Policy, please do not hesitate to contact us.

## Permissions
The app accesses one permission in order to operate. 

### [Camera][camera-per]
Scannerate requests access to the camera in order to capture an image from where the text is extracted from. 

This is essential to the apps functionality.
The image itself is not stored, and only exists temporarily until the text extraction is finished.

Note that the app CANNOT capture any videos.
